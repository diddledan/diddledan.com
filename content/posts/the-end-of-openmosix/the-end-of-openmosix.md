Is this ~~the final stages of the OpenMosix clustering addition to the Linux kernel~~? It has been announced from Moshe Bar, the leader of the openMosix project, that he wishes to leave the project and shut down development. The first I heard of this was a curious question on the oM users mailing list, and has since been confirmed by a mailing by Moshe himself. Florian Delizy has since said that he will continue his own development, and so will a few others, creating a fork of the OpenMosix code if needed.
