As a follow-up to my recent posting about Samba, Virtualmin and Windows interoperability I found, on the MSDN site, some ~~documentation on how to use the LDAP protocol to create entries in the Active Directory database~~. I shall look this over and see if it is possible to use the information to add entries using the "LDAP Users and Groups" module of Virtualmin/Webmin. First, though, I need to reinstall my Windows 2003 Server R2.
