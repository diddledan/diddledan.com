Zemanta is a fancy [firefox plugin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Firefox_extensions) that enables you to scour the [social web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_web) for any related articles and images which can be utilised to enhance a blog entry. Once installed, Zemanta will modify the layout of your blog's add new post screen to give you more options. These options being relevant photos, related articles and links all of which are derived from your entry's text as you write it.

As you can see in the above paragraph, I have clicked the "apply all" button in my related links box to automatically link the words Zemanta, [plugin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_%28computing%29) and "social web" to the Zemanta homepage, and wikipedia's entries on [plugins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_%28computing%29) and the social web.

What's even more amazing about the zemanta product is that the entire thing is FREE!
