Just a quickie to say that is amazing. My blog can now be viewed on any internet capable mobile cell phone. I can also admin my site easily on the said same phones, without a client application being required.

Posted from my phone.

## Update, 2013

Enabling my blog with Wapple.net made mobile users much happier in 2009. Wapple provided a service combined with a WordPress plugin to mobile-optimise sites. I have since discontinued my relationship with Wapple.
