I was browsing through Engadget this evening, and this posting caught my eye. My parents have a cat, and I think this would be ideal for them. Not least because they also have stray foreign cats also coming in through the cat flap uninvited.

Basically the premise is that the unit will only allow those cats with the right RFID chip to use the flap, and as they do a camera will snap a picture of them and upload to twitter along with a funny quote.

See the [Engadget Article on RFID/Twitter-enabled Cat Flap](https://www.engadget.com/2009/04/09/intelligent-cat-door-utilizes-twitter-rfid-masterfully/)
