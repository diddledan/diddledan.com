I have installed an interesting application â€“ [BlogJet](https://blogjet.com/). It's a cool Windows client for my blog tool (as well as for other tools). Get your copy of BlogJet here: [https://blogjet.com](https://blogjet.com/). Being a Windows-native application, and that I'm running on a Mac, I've installed it in Crossover Mac.

The installation procedure for BlogJet in XOver is as follows:

1. install XOver 8.0 (which is in beta at time of writing).
2. create and install an Internet Explorer 7 "bottle".
3. select "install unsupported software" and install BlogJet into the same IE7 bottle\*.

\*it has to be the same bottle that has an existing installation of MS Internet Explorer, as BlogJet uses the HTML render engine within the application to display your posts in a WYSIWYG manner (What You See Is What You Get).
