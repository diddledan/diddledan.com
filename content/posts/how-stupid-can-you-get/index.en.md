A guy by the name of Roger Friedman, who writes an entertainment column for the Fox News web-site, has been "axed" (<span class="removed_link" title="http://coverawards.com/2009/04/06/news_roger_friedman_fired_3819/">Cover Awards Blog</span>). It's the circumstances that are a bit crazy, though. He reviewed a copy of the new X-Men film "Wolverine", but he hadn't seen an official release. Instead, he had reviewed a leaked pirate copy. What's worse, is that he actually stated in his column that it was a pirate copy he reviewed.

> \[I also found\] the whole top 10 \[movie releases\], plus TV shows, commercials, videos, everything, all streaming away. It took really less than seconds to start playing it all right onto my computer. I could have downloaded all of it but really, who has the time or the room?

He also goes on to say

> Later tonight I may finally catch up with Paul Rudd in "I Love You, Man." It's so much easier than going out in the rain!

What a nutter to tell the whole world about his illegal watchings.
