So, I've got the urge to write a story. I haven't got any inspiration though, so post your comments below for ideas that I can write about. I thought about maybe a story with psychiatric overtones/undertones and any other type of tones, as that would be something that I "know". (They always say to budding authors to "write what you know".)

The problem with writing about psychiatric events is that you have to be very careful to leave the reader satisfied rather than just depressed and upset about what they have read. i.e. you can't have the protagonist commit suicide at the end of the book, as that is a rather unsettling ending that no reader will in their right minds think as satisfactory.

Just had an interesting idea as I was writing this blog post: aim at the geek market and write a thriller about the shady world of open-source development and the possible underworld connections that it so obviously has. Worth pursuing maybe?

COMMENT PLEASE. I NEED IDEAS: characters, places, events, twists, etc. anything you can think of, really, including complete story ideas.
