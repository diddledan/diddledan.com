WOW, I've just discovered spanning sync: . This nifty utility synchronises your google contacts and calendar with your mac's addressbook and iCal with little-to-no fuss whatsoever. AND, once you've signed up you can refer friends to the service saving them 5$ like clicking on ~~this link~~ will do for you. A Bonus in the system is that they will also pay you 5$ for every person your link refers who also buys the service.
