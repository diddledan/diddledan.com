<del datetime="2010-06-29T00:14:09+00:00">As part of my ongoing efforts to unify Wordbook and Fotobook, I have added the same check that the author of wordbook put in place into fotobook. This check determines whether the facbook API has already been loaded by the time the plugin executes and loads it if necessary. Also in this release is thickbox support.</del>

The above updates are now present in stock fotobook, so are no longer required in my patch. I will update the download when I get around to it, dropping the compatibility changes and just focussing on the thickbox angle.

I have submitted the thickbox capability upstream to the original author of fotobook, but have not received a reply as yet.

(Older versions linked to here as a courtesy. If the download is crossed through then there is a <del datetime="2010-06-29T00:14:09+00:00">better</del> newer version available.)
