As Bender the robot from Futurama would say: OH.. YOUR.. GOD!! I found links to MP3s of popcorn!!

For those of you that have never heard of popcorn, listen up.. Originally composed by one Gershon Kingsley, popcorn is one of the all-time greats. This track is instantly recognisable, and has been covered umpteen times. I found a site with [79 different cover versions of this Popcorn music track](https://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2007/03/79_versions_of_.html).
