I can definitely relate to what CuBeZeRo says in his ~~blog entry "I'm so unfit"~~:

> I was helping to move my sister into her new flat today, I had a look around and the place is really nice, only thing i do not envy is the 3 flights of stairs to get up there every time. I was worn out carrying the first box to the top.By the time we had finished, I was soaking wet from sweating so much and just wanted to lay down.

Since starting medication for depression way back in 2000 I've almost doubled in weight to about 21-stone. This means that I just cannot get around as easily as I used to. I find just walking any distance tiring, especially if I'm in a hurry. Still, even though I live on the second floor of my apartment building, I always go up the stairs. My legs are capable, it's just my respiration system that can't keep up, and I end up sweating if I exert myself too much. I find just moving a computer from one room to another a strain (though by computer I mean a fscking huge Compaq Proliant which weighs-in at about 65 lbs). At last check, my blood pressure was, surprisingly, only just a little elevated, so at least my heart is ok ;-).
