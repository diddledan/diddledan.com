You obviously choose Windows XP if you're new to computers and do NOT WANT to learn new programs; you obviously choose ubuntu if you WANT to learn new programs for email and word processing. Ubuntu is for open source programmers only!

Dell, we applaud you for your fair and even handed explanation that Linux is crap and people only use it because they're short-sighted.
