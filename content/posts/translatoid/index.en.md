I've just put in place a new translation widget that seems better than all others by virtue of the fact that it translates the text of my site in-situ. This means that users aren't forwarded to another server and placed in a framed view of my site, but instead stay viewing the same page without redirections. Basically that allows users to carry on viewing my site without clicking back and forward buttons all the time.

Unfortunately, some of you may decide that the translator is a bad idea, just because it's a MicrosoftÂ® service. I tried the other options, such as babelfish from yahoo and google translate, and found that the MS one had the better implementation.

If you're worried about big brother watching over your shoulder, you can use something like firefox's advert blocking extension to prevent the script from being loaded and thus your data being sent to "big bad".
