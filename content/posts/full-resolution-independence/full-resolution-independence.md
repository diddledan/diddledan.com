I've been playing with the CSS layout code of my site, and have now made the display capable of complete screen resolution independence down to screens running at 640Ã—480.

On another note I tried Qumana, my blog editor of choice, under ubuntu 9.04. However, it would seem that the application can't spawn any new windows. This is rather essential, as the initial display doesn't include any editing capabilities, requiring a new window to add or edit blog entries.
