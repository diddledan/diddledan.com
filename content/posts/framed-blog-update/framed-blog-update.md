I've just uploaded an update to my framedblog plugin for WordPress. You can find information about it on the framedblog page by clicking the link on the right-hand navigation column of this site. Of note, and the reason for the update, is that back and forward buttons *and* editing of the address bar in-situ. are all supported.

This means that clicking the back button will, with a maximum of 1 second delay, navigate to the previous page viewed. Also, changing anything after the # symbol on the addressbar and hitting enter will have the same effect as navigating directly to that page, only within the frameset.

I've not tested this in Internet Explorer yet...
