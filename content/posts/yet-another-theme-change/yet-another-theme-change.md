I was getting depressed with my site being *SO* black. Because of this, I decided to browse through some of the stock themes on ~~IND-Web.com's Blogging Platform~~. In the end I settled on one called Ocean Wide. I had to tweak it a little bit due to the author's use of his own version of [the jQuery JavaScript library](https://www.jquery.com/) instead of the version that everyone else uses that comes with easy invocation and dependency tracking by WordPress itself. Once I'd made the theme call the correct version of jQuery everything else started working again, such as the sexy bookmarks. I've also made the theme use my own header image (this is utilising the custom header image setting within the admin screen of any blog that uses the theme). All in all, I quite like this theme for my site as it's wider than my Theme De Frem, and much lighter and easier on the eye; I tend to think of black backgrounds as arty but often bad for typography.
