I came across this video and just had to share it with someone, but I had more to say than would fit into Facebook or Twitter (and who uses Google+?!)

I love that he is so excited that he can barely speak. It's absolutely great that someone from one of the older generations (read: alive before the 1990's) can get into and find uses for technology that kids take for granted.

With "tablets" and smart-phones (iPhone, iPad, Android and others) the whole landscape has shifted to a point where a computing device can be used by anyone without any prior computing experience or training. Finally we're at a point where technology is becoming a facilitator rather than something for only for geeks. These devices are delivering on the unspoken promise that the founders of the internet made to the world; information will be freely accessible by everyone, anywhere, and at any time.
