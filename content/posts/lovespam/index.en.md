We all receive them, and we all ignore them, but sometimes they can reveal interesting things. e.g.

Don't you love spams that come from a n00bie spammer who just paid for access to a "one-click spam everyone" tool, but didn't read the documentation? What follows below is a true spam that I received today with no alterations whatsoever (excepting the headers which I've removed from the top of the message to try to reduce it's size a bit â€“ they have no bearing other than to detail how Google delivered it. The subject is an interesting one, because I didn't know "Lucas" was in a "Star Wars legal fight". However, the important bit to note about the email is the address they try to send me to.

Yes, folks, it really is the age-old "I'm too stupid to fill out all the replacements properly when mail-merging" problem. Only in this instance it successfully prevents me from looking a fool by clicking the link and signing up to whatever they're advertising and not receiving anything other than a hefty bill from fraudsters. Wait, stop looking at me like that; it only happened that one time!
