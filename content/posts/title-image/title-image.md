While I'm awake in the small hours again, I have been looking over my site and realised that I've not posted any details about the image I'm using for my header. That is, the sunset you see at the top of this very page. Well, it was taken on a Sony Ericsson Mobile Telephone (I forget the model). I took the photo myself at the top of a hill just outside Kingsclere in the north of Hampshire on the border of Berkshire (or maybe it's just inside Berkshire, I'm not sure). The view itself is looking out across the famous piece of land that was immortalised in book-form by Richard Adams. That piece of land? Watership Down, the home of many a real rabbit, and one or two fictional ones.

I edited the image in a little-known piece of software for the Apple OS X platform called [Pixelmator](https://www.pixelmator.com/).
